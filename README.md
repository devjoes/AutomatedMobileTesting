# Automated UI testing

These are the resources for a talk that I'm doing. All of this has been thrown together quite quickly so this needs tidying up. A lot of the resources in here are from previous incarnations (it took me 6 iterations to get this all working!)

What is missing from this is is the actual image of a virtual machine with the Android SDK and VS Android Emulator installed. This will be provided soon either as a Cloud Init file or a powershell script.
